# Steel Defect Detection

This project focuses on detecting surface defects in steel using deep learning. It uses image-based classification to identify flaws such as scratches, rolled-in scales, and patches.

The code is written in Python and organized into separate modules for training, configuration, and utility functions. The main notebook (`main.ipynb`) handles model training and evaluation.

### Dataset  
We use the NEU Surface Defect Dataset, which can be downloaded from:  
ðŸ”— https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zy12345/neudet

After downloading, place the dataset in a folder named `NEU-DET`.

### How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
2. Open and run `main.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook
